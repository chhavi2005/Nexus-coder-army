<!-- how img is store? obviously in binary -->
<!-- but how it is converted to binary? through pixels -->
<!-- it reads the number of pixels/rows and columns 100rows*100cols =10k pixels-->
<!-- every pixel can have some diff shade -->
<!-- any color can be made through RGB in this world -->
<!-- how color is stores? RGB stores from 0-255 values or 8 bits total 24 bits to store a color of 1 pixel -->
<!-- then those 0-255 value of r,g,b is converted to binary or 8bits each -->
<!-- memory taken by photo if 10k pixels =  10k*30bytes = 30kbytes -->
<!-- image clarity depends on these bits only maybe it stores 30/48bits -->
<!-- in 48 bits value will be stored till 0-65535 / 16bits each for r,g,b -->
