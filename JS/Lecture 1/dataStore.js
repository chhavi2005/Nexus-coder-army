// PRINT IN JS
    console.log("Hello Coder Army !!!")

// HISTORY OF JS
    // google chrome has v8 engine - js compiler basically for chrome but not exactly compiler it JIT - Just In Time
    // to make js run fast
    // spidermonkey is the engine of js for mozilla firefox
    // browser make their js engine but have to follow standards by ECMA - europe organization which decide standards for programming and other language stuff
    // js engine - js code into binary (js engine is also a code which converts)
    // compiler work - convert code into binary
    // v8 engine - famous because its fast
    // js engine is made through c++(70%+) because it is fast
    // in browser there is engine already injected to run js but on vs code any js engine is not there so node.js was made
    // to run js outside the browser
    // node.js - v8engine + extra functionality
    // install node.js
    // by writing node file_name in terminal we can use it in vs code
    // node.js is used in frontend (earlier) and now also backend

// STORE DATA IN JS
    // let const var

    // let
    // no need to define datatype just make a variable with let at starting
    let num = 10;
    console.log(num);

    let naam = "Chhavi";
    naam = "Vanya"
    console.log(naam);

    // const
    // á¹­o make a constant variable which can't be changed if re assign
    const pin = 10023
    console.log(pin)
    // pin=33109
    // we get an error

    // var
    // same as let but old way now let is used instead
    // some disadvantage related to block scope 
    // DON'T USE IT !!
